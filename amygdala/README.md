High-resolution in vivo atlases of the amygdala
=================================================

These atlases are described in:

     Treadway MT, Waskom ML, Dillon DG, et al. Illness Progression, Recent
     Stress, and Morphometry of Hippocampal Subfields and Medial Prefrontal Cortex
     in Major Depression. Biol Psychiatry. 2014;

Please cite this paper when using these atlases.

These atlases are defined on the same subjects as the Cerebellar and
Hippocampal subfield atlases. To obtain the subject T1 and T2 images for these
labels, or for more information, please visit:

The manual segmentation protocol used to produce these atlases is described in:

    Entis JJ, Doerga P, Barrett LF, Dickerson BC. A reliable protocol for the
    manual segmentation of the human amygdala and its subregions using ultra-high
    resolution MRI. Neuroimage. 2012;60(2):1226-35.
